"The konark wheel is absolutely phenomenal, no doubt. What a significant showcase of richness of our ancient advance culture"
Don't think any Indian PM has had this kind of rapport with global leaders...
That's looks incredibly Beautiful Indian (Bharat) ❤ The Heritage of Mankind
"We feels so proud to be a part of Bharat , indeed a Historical moment created with Gracious      and precious presence of all World leaders as One Earth One Family One Future. Jai Bharat Jai Modi congratulations to all for witnessing the togetherness of Growth in all sectors as a whole humanity . The World is becoming more beautiful , Sustainable with economic growth."

"It's historical movement for all indian. Wherever we live, our hearts are always in India. We feel proud."
"THIS MAN IS LITERALLY BORN FOR MAKING HISTORY ❤️❤️❤️ JAI HIND , 
JAI BHARAT 🇮🇳"
"♥️🇧🇩♥️🇮🇳❤️ I am from Bangladesh and I congratulate all Indians for the successful Indian scientific mission to the moon. Also, I thank Indian people for welcoming our PM Sheikh Hasina. We are grateful to India for helping us during our liberation war against the then West Pakistan. We value India Bangladesh friendship for ever. Bangladesh wants to maintain friendship with all countries including the USA and China. Infact, the USA and China are the two major trading partners of Bangladesh. In the present regional and geopolitical context, the present government under the leadership of PM Sheikh Hasina have been facing multi-dimensional challenges. For example, Sheikh Hasina's government have been maintaining secularism in Bangladesh (a Muslim majority country) and fighting against Islamist terrorists, which is a major threat to peace and prosperity of Bangladesh and to the regional security. Secondly, some unresolved issues like the Tista water sharing agreement contributing to existing anti- Indian sentiment among Bangladeshi people fueling Islamic fundamentalism that goes against Sheikh Hasina and her government. Third and most importantly, the USA hegemonic pressure and hostile actions against Bangladesh. The Hasina government do not want to be aligned with the USA against China which is a major trading and development partner of Bangladesh. That is why the USA is in a mission of regime change in Bangladesh overthrowing the Hasina Government. The USA have been patronizing opposition parties, BNP and other Islamic fundamentalist parties who are anti-Indian, against the Hasina government in upcoming national election, which is due in 4 months. The USA already imposed sanctions last year on some top officials of a law enforcement agency citing human rights violation. Also, the USA threatened to impose more sanctions on the present government in the pretext of ""facilitating democracy in Bangladesh."""

Proud Moment for us🇮🇳
My observation on this... Pm Modi only moved after the centerline twice to greet the dignitaries.. Once for US President and second for Russian FM.. This shows the respect and importance these two countries carries for India.. Hugs were another body language indicative which were reserved for the Head of states closure to Modi. Kings of UAE and Saudi were a nice surprise of our PM signature hugs
Love you Modi ji. I  am proud I am Bharat basi.❤❤❤❤❤
India Rocks.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑 proud to be a Indian 🎉🎉🎉🎉

"Remarkable bodylanguages

UK PM be like , the most kattar bhai , dhaga and namaste. Pride of India , abroad.

Great respect for President Al Sisi , namaste.

Chinese PM is too loaded with protocols to walk frankly and smile nicely.

Italian PM's mood got brighter seeing PM Modi.

Turk President is having difficulty smiling, due to PM Modi's visit to Greece.

Happy to see US President walking the full corridor without falling or going the other way.

Russian FM is here to enjoy diplomatic circus , he is welcome 

😊"

Really missing Putin 's unique walking style 😅 here
Jai bharat🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
"Very nice G20 and Moody did very well as a host, very representative of his country, but I believe that the welcoming of the Saudi crown prince MBS, and the president MBZ from  AEU was a bit over the top, considering that Dubaï has more or less been built by (poor) Indian labors who lived and still live with very little rights, very low salaries, esp. considering how rich the Emirates are, and than again how much Bharat/India has suffered from Islamic invasions. Was there ever a public recognition of these invasions? On a political level such recognition would only improve the image of Islam in the world."
WE ❤️ OUR PM FOR BETTER TOMORROW
Bharat❤
Rishi & Modi. Son & father equation. ❤ Both respecting each other🙏
Thank you modi ji for making BHARAT Proud 🇮🇳

"Let me burst the bubble of those stupid people who seem to think that it was solely because of Narendra Modi  leadership abilities that India is hosting the G20 summit.

Let's get one thing straight:
The G20 summit is on a rotational basis! It's not like India won some kind of global popularity contest and is being showered with this prestigious opportunity because of Modi's charm (or lack thereof). The fact of the matter is that hosting duties are determined by a predetermined rotation system, which means India had its turn in line to host this grand event. So, before you start giving all the credit to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for something that would have happened regardless of who was or is in power, maybe take a moment to educate yourself on the actual facts that Brazil will host the 2024 G20 summit next, followed by South Africa in 2025.
Get the facts straight fellas!!!"
Great.... ❤️
Leader of the world Modiji
Why was Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov allowed to attend this G20 Summit while President Putin would be arrested as he descends his Areoflot plane?
"Modiji speaks in Hindi before world leaders
 There are two possibilities here
 1. Speaking the mother tongue of India
 2. Does not know English
 There is an illustration for those who think
 😢"

Why is Italian PM laughing so much is anything about antonio😂😂
"Observations : a) Rishi Sunak does 'namaste' naturally and properly, since he's grown up doing it. NOT King Charlie, who splays his fingers, and shakes his hand while doing namaste     b) Why didn't Modi 'jhappi maar' the delectable Italian Prime Minister when he had the chance 😄😄?     c) The President of Brazil arrives.......with a girlfriend (/ translator) !!    d) Modi jhappi maroed the following: PM of UK, President of UAE, Crown Prince of Saudi. Says a lot about the India's priorities/ the strength of ties, I guess."
This is India's moment 😊
Putin and xi jinping should have also come it would have been great event

"Forget our Poverty. Forget our unemployment. Forget our usual troubles corruption, nepotism etc for a while. We have guests from far and near. Let us extend to them the world renowned Indian Hospitality and make them take sweet memories of their stay in India which in any case is not lasting for more than four days. Let them take the impression that when it comes to treating guests, nobody can beat Indians. Remember that most of these nations are our biggest trading partners and are also home to many of our NRI brothers and sisters. Two days of inconvenience in any manner should be borne by Delhites with a cheer. 
Monumental days in the history of Delhi and India. 
It is not on every day that we have leaders of a group of nearly 30 countries amidst us, visiting our country. 
Bad Luck, Presidents of Russia and China. However we miss them."

Good information
"The size of economy (in trillions) are brain numbing techniques used by the western countries (post WW2) to have poor countries keep working for them. India in not the global engine of growth but the global supplier of cheap labor and consumer of western products and that is exactly what US wants them to do. As for living condition, most tier 1 and tier 2/3 cities are unlivable due to roads overflown with traffic, pollution and high density of population. There is not even a concept of public playgrounds, garden or other public amenities in India. Indian primary education is getting more and more expensive. Modi govt. has done nothing except working towards facilitating the corporates (both indian and foreign) to tap the overcrowded indian cities to their advantage. In return he gets all the help (funding) from these blood thirsty organisations (Adanis/ambanis) to win elections.😅"
